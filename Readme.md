# A Strategy Game Framework

This is a WIP side-project implementing a flexible framework for creating grid-based strategy games. About half this project is currently within this repository. The remainder contains closed-source code, and will be refactored and added to this repository over time.

## Fun Features

-Supports grids and movement across any number of dimensions, including 4+.
-Supports units, movement, and actions for objects of any size, whether they are contiguous or not.
-Supports undoing and redoing of any action.
